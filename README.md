[The Factory](https://pcampbell42.github.io/the-factory/) is a top-down browser game. The game was originally designed to be a full on dungeon crawler, but for the sake of keeping things short and sweet, it now has a fixed 10 levels. The player plays as a cyborg, and must defeat all enemies on a floor to move to the next one. There are two boss fights, one on floor 5 and the other on floor 10. Once the final boss is defeated, the game is completed.
